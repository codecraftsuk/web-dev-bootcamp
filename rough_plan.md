# Planning

These are not notes, just a plan of what we may teach.

## Week 1

### Source control with Git


Create a GitHub account, learn basic git commands to get by with creating repo, git pull and pushing so that they can create a repo in which they can put their notes in, do homeworks and projects.

```
What is Git
Setup Git
Git commits
Git clone

```

```
Introduction
What is git?
What is version control?
Git commands
sign up in GitHub
using git in local machine
git install
getting code editor
inside VS Code
cloning through VS Code
git commit command
git add command
committing
git push command

Maybe even visual studio code download and using git with it.

```
Version control: Version control is a system that keeps track of changes made to files over time. It allows developers to undo changes, collaborate on code, and share their work with others. It is important to teach the basics of version control to students so that they understand the benefits of using Git and GitHub.

Git basics: Git is a command-line tool that is used for version control. To use Git, students will need to learn basic commands such as "git init" (to initialize a repository), "git add" (to stage changes), "git commit" (to save changes), and "git diff" (to compare versions). It's also important to teach how to create branches and how to merge them back.

GitHub: GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. Students will learn how to create a repository on GitHub, how to push code to a remote repository, and how to collaborate on projects with other developers. They will also learn how to clone a repository and how to pull changes from a remote repository.
Branching and merging: Branching is a way to work on multiple features of a project at the same time without affecting the main branch. Students will learn how to create a branch, switch between branches, and merge changes back into the main branch.

Pull requests: Pull requests are a way for developers to review and merge code changes. Students will learn how to create a pull request, how to review code changes, and how to merge changes into the main branch.

Resolving conflicts: Conflicts can occur when merging code changes from different branches. Students will learn how to resolve conflicts by using Git's merge tool or by editing the conflicting files manually.
Best practices: Good coding practices are important for any developer. Students will learn best practices for using Git and GitHub, such as writing clear commit messages, using branches effectively, and keeping a clean repository.

Hands-on practice: To master Git and GitHub, students need to practice. Provide exercises and projects that allow students to use Git and GitHub in a real-world setting.
```

## Week 2

### HTML

```
How the web works (HTTP request and response etc)

Chrome dev tools, inspecting web page 

HTML Basics (Head Body and go through all tags)

Entities (How to use & signs and > signs)

Validating html using validator (see how well your code is written with best practises)

```

```
To teach HTML, you will need to cover the following topics in detail:

Basic HTML structure: Teach the basic structure of an HTML document, including the doctype declaration, head, and body.

HTML tags: Explain the different types of HTML tags, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and tables. Show examples of how to use each tag and explain their attributes.

Best practices: Cover best practices for creating well-structured, accessible, and responsive HTML documents.

Examples and practice: Provide examples of real-world HTML pages and give students the opportunity to practice creating their own HTML documents.

It's important to note that HTML is the foundation of website development, and it's important to teach students how it works and how to use it properly.
